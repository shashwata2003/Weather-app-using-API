SO a Api consists of:
-a end point
- paths
- parameters
- and authnetication


So in a url the first half is a end point which gives direct acces to the api with out any special search option like:

https://api.kanye.rest

This link of the api is called the end point api that means no special search option

not a api link that have a search option or we call it paths and parameters like:

https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Any 

till /joke it is end point link and after that the catagory ANy is a special path that is need to be handles in the node and react module. with the catch key world

now we can also apply different parameters to this link which will help us to handle the search more effictivly.

like:

https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Programming?blacklistFlags=nsfw&type=single&contains=array

here the catagory is Programming and after that all the parameters are applied like the flag of nsfw , the type pf singlr line etc.
