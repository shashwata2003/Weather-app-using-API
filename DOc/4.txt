SO in the real world a data is tranfered in the form of json file because it allows us to compress the data in a very less memory string and it can be easily converted to the original javascript format at the user end easily.

hence when a json is tranfered it converts the data into a string hence takes very less storage and then transfers it . and also in the user end we can easily convert it to the js format.

also JSON can be easily read.

we can tranfer data in the form of XML(Extensible Markup Language) and HTML(Hyper text markup Language) format also but json(javascript object notation)
